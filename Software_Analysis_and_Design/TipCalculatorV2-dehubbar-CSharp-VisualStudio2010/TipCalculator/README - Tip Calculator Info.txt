Tip Calculator created by Dave Hubbard using Visual Studio 2010 and C#.

To run, open the "TipCalculator" Visual Studio Solution and press the Start Debugging
button (little green arrow on the top bar) or just press F5.


Instructions:
The three icons in the top right corner are used to navigate pages at any time:

- The $ sign is the tip calculation main page.
- The two people represent the tip tailoring page.
- The the wrench is for the configuration page.

- Text Fields are calculated when the cursor leaves the box. Pressing TAB is effective.
- Sliders calculate in real time.

Issues:

- There are still issues with rounding.
