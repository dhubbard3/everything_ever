CSE240 Assignment 2

1) What does static mean for function-local variables?
  
   [Static variables are kept in memory even when the function ends. Upon
    calling the function again, the variable will remain intact.]


2) What does static mean for functions and global variables?

   [Static functions and global variables can be read by any other functions
    in the file, but only if they are part of the same file (functions are
    localized).]

3) Where is the second dimension of our Connect Four game board?
   
   [Included in the type definition for Connect4_Column_t, there is an array
    of variables for the pieces dropped into the board. This is the second
    dimension.]

4) What are the possible values of Bool by our definition?

  [ The value 1 indicates True, and the value 0 indicates False.]

What do the other values not defined as constants mean if used as the
predicate expression in an if statement?

  [ They seem to default to true. I'm not entirely sure.]
