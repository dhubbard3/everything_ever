2. Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work.

	Creating a virus to delete another user's files or enabling remote access
	and connecting to another computer to "possess" the mouse cursor is not only
	unethical, it's annoying as well.


4. Thou shalt not use a computer to steal.

	Writing a program such as a keylogger to gain passwords and other private
	information from an unsuspecting user is definately a form of stealing.


7. Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization.

	For example, hacking a company server to find out if Jim from accounting makes
	more money than you. Bypassing the server authorization is a no-no.


8. Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output.

	In other words, don't take some one elses work, change a few things around
	here and there, and call it your own. Plagarism is highly frowned upon in
	any field of work.


9. Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you write.

	Let's say you are a former CIA agent with extensive knowledge of dangerous
	government secrets. If you were to program a game that revealed all of these
	secrets, the result could prove to be catastrophic. Or possibly hilarious.
	Either way, it's probably not a good idea.
